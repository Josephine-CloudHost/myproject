            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm [Josephine S. Saah]. I am a web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites. This is my portfolio where I showcase my projects
             I'm a Junior Student @ Starz University, chassing dreams that feels both near and far. Days filled with books,
             late nights under the stars, Balancing ambition with who I want to be.


             So here I am a work in progress, At Starz University, giving my best.
             A junior now, but soon you'll see, The person I was always meant to be.



             I also  hold a certificate in "BEAUTY CARE", where passion meet purpose, and skills became my Splendor.
             Transforming beauty into confidence from the heart. 
             Each class was a step, each practice refined, A journey of creativity and discipline combined.
             It's more than just makeup or styling hair, it's about helping others feel empowered and rare.

             
             
             This certificate I hold is my foundation to grow, A career in beauty where my talents will show.
             With my client, a new story to share, A proud graduate of Beauty Care.
